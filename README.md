Whether you're looking to rent, or list your personal trailer to earn some additional income, **LoadCo** is the right place for you.

Avoid the headache of going through a large company to rent something of theirs for an absurd price and connect with one of our many members who are listing their trailers at an affordable price, right next door!

On the landing page, you will have access to the Navigation bar, containing a couple links, and the Quick Search feature.

The Quick Search is exactly as it sounds. The user needs only to submit a location to be provided with a list of available trailers, based on seaerched location.

If the user wishes to have a more comprehensive list displayed, they should simply click on the **Listings** link; found on the Navbar.
They will be then taken to a page that looks like the below:
